# ProjectEuler
This repository is a collection of solutions I have created to Project Euler problems. Project Euler is an online database of mathematical problems to be solved using coding. The directions are simple and can be executed in any language, but the problems quickly become more complex, both mathematically and technically. For my particular application, I have choosen to work in Processing, because of my familiarity with the language, but more importantly because the compiler is built into the program. This makes it very useful for testing out algorithms, as it removes the need for running files in the command line. I choose this project as a start-point because I can complete one problem at a time without worrying about constructing a much larger program. While I am working on Project Euler, I will simultaneously begin to study the feasibility of a various computer vision applications.
